all the certificates are existing here
 ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/ ==(public key infrastructure)

for etcd there is a sub directory all components for etcd 
ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd 

create one directory
mkdir backup-certs
after copy the certificates
cp -r /etc/kubernetes/pki backup-certs
ls backup-certs
upto here tls certificates are backed up
=======================================================
create snapshot for etcd control
apt  install golang-go
go mod init myproject
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/etcdctl
order to get client on the system 
apt  install etcd-client
etcdctl ---this command should work

sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save backup-etcd/snapshot.db --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key 

ls backup-etcd/
o/p snapshot.db

we are backuped all the required certificates and keys for cluster componemts 
=========================================================

kubeadm reset -f 
kubectl get nodes 
o/p --connection refused everything is reset 

now we will restore the clusster

cp -r backup-certs/pki /etc/kubernetes/
ls /etc/kubernetes/pki/


now we have to restore etcd server this is the command

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore backup-etcd/snapshot.db
ls default.etcd/
apt  install tree
tree default.etcd/
know we have to copy member directory completely to different path
mv default.etcd/member /var/lib/etcd/
ls /var/lib/etcd/
tree /var/lib/etcd/  ===> we have successfully moved the things to the destination 

kubeadm init --ignore-preflight-errors=DirAvailable--var-ilb-etcd 

if this will not work we have to remove the var/lin/etcd
 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/etcd/*
after this run the kubeadm init command  

  ==== which means that while the cluster is initializing it should ignore data for etcd server and it should take that data from the directory var/lib/etcd  in the previous step we copied in the directory so etcd is going to fetch the information form that directory and kubeadm will do rest of the things for us
